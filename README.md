# quicksteam

A small python program to display Steam stats, with various commands available to display information from different categories.

Imported libraries:
`steam`
`json`
`requests`
`datetime`

This was a personal project I chose to learn OOP and WebAPI in Python, it is scuffed and potentially inefficient. But it is my first program with OOP implemented from scratch. I tried to incorporate a lot of different things I learned into the program.
